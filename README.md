**Note to employers visiting this repository:**  The code in this respository is for a project in a database class.  For some inexplicable reason, we were limited to the use of SQL databases. (i.e. We couldn't use someting like MongoDB.)  Furthermore, since the focus is on the database portion, we put more logic into the Database then normal and less logic than normal in the non DB parts.
